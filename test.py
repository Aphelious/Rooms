# What if we had a testing frame work that 
# 1. looked at the versions of the SQLs in the feature branch
# 2. then actually connected to Snowflake and got samples of the data in question
# 3. Maybe also looked at the master branch and got samples using that version of the code
# 4. Performed some analysis on the output, % nulls, overall counts, basic data validation
